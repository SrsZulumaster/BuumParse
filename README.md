# BuumParse

This has been put to the side because there was little to no learning and consumed too much of time i could use to learn other things.


This is a project mainly for learning but to also save some time copy/pasting from a program into a .ods file.
In this project i use PyAutoGUI and PyTesseract.
The list of used packages will probably increase with the project

Project currently very badly formatted, while I work to have it functional
